# Deep Learning Fundamentals
1. Learn how to prepare the different layers and the weights to be used for forward propagation in a neural network.

The example data above is for a professional where the two inputs are age and work experience, both measured in years. The weights are given along the lines between the nodes. The forward propagation algorithm will predict the annual Salary for the professional, measured in thousands of USD.

Before we code the forward propagation values, we need to set up the input layers and the weights in Python.

2. You're now ready to compute and predict the value of the output with the forward propagation process.
